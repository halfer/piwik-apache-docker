To build:

	docker build -t piwik .

To run:

	./host-start.sh

This will expose the app just on the local network, and then Apache can be
used on the host to proxy it to the outside world.

To clean up dead images:

	docker images | grep "<none>" | grep "weeks ago" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi
