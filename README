To build:

	docker build -t piwik .

To run:

	./host-start.sh

This will expose the app just on the local network, and then Apache can be
used on the host to proxy it to the outside world.

To get a shell prompt for debugging:

	docker exec -it mycontainer bash

To clean up dead images:

	docker images | grep "<none>" | grep "weeks ago" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi
